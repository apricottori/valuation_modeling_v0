## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Google AI Studio API key (for AI features)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/value-web-app.git
   cd value-web-app
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser

3. For AI features, add your Google AI Studio API key in the financial structure section

## Usage

### 1. Financial Structure Setup
- Enter company information
- Configure business segments
- Set up cost structure with variable/fixed ratios
- Use AI to validate cost models

### 2. Scenario Modeling
- Create scenarios for each business segment
- Choose growth models (CAGR, Growth, Logistic)
- Set probabilities and model-specific parameters
- Add notes and get AI review

### 3. Simulation
- Run Monte Carlo simulation
- Analyze results and distributions
- Export data for further analysis

### 4. Investment Analysis
- Review value distributions
- Analyze upside/downside scenarios
- Make informed investment decisions

## Data Management

- **Export**: Save all data as JSON file
- **Import**: Load previously saved data
- **Local Storage**: Automatic data persistence

## Growth Models

### CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
- Simple compound growth model
- Requires mean growth rate and standard deviation

### Growth (Convergence)
- Growth rate converges to terminal growth rate over forecast period
- Requires initial growth rate, standard deviation, and convergence period

### Logistic Regression
- S-curve growth model
- Parameters: TAM (Total Addressable Market), inflection point, initial value
- TAM grows annually by terminal growth rate
